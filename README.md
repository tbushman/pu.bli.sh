#about
pu.bli.sh is a self-publishing domain. The example shown demonstrates the design portfolio application of pu.bli.sh, but any content is supported with associated script edits (i.e. change img to iframe or something like this). 
Use CartoDB to update the content with your own map. Available fields are: 'name', 'description', 'pic1', 'pic2', 'pic3', 'pic4', 'pic5', and 'timeline' (corresponds to the timemarker id used by Timeline JS). Create your timeline separately and embed it using the URL provided by your Timeline JS Google spreadsheet.

Accessibility improvements pending.
